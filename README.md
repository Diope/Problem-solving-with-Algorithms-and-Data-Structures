## Problem Solving with Algorithms & Data Structures

This is is simply my repository to house the challenges and examples found in the book [Problem Solving With Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.amazon.com/Problem-Solving-Algorithms-Structures-Python/dp/1590282574)

I highly recommend the book, it's a great way to introduce and teach readers about algorithms and data structure. It dives deep into it all without losing the reader.

Each chapter is broken down into it's own folder, I have notes for some of the chapters (I alternate between written and typed) for those who want to read the notes or are curious themselves about what this book teaches.

As a junior developer I've had many debates with my senior developers about the necessity to learn programming on a more fundamental level. I enjoy learning these things in general and enjoy learning about programming in all it's aspects (to be clear, I am learning about data structures and like of my own volition as I believe it will make me a better programmer and will help me better understand how to best solve complex problems, and to a greater extent helps me better learn the building blocks of programming languages which pays dividends when I need to switch technologies.) I'll most likely never be a 10x programmer but I strive to be a competent one who is a great addition to any team.
