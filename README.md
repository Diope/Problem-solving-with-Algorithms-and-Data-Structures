## Problem Solving with Algorithms & Data Structures

This is is simply my repository to house the challenges and examples found in the book [Problem Solving With Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.amazon.com/Problem-Solving-Algorithms-Structures-Python/dp/1590282574)

I highly recommend the book, it's a great way to introduce and teach readers about algorithms and data structure. It dives deep into it all without losing the reader.

Each chapter is broken down into it's own folder, I have notes for some of the chapters (I alternate between written and typed) for those who want to read the notes or are curious themselves about what this book teaches.
