## Problem Solving with Algorithms & Data Structures

This is is simply my repository to house the challenges and examples found in the book [Problem Solving With Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.amazon.com/Problem-Solving-Algorithms-Structures-Python/dp/1590282574)

I highly recommend the book, it's a great way to introduce and teach readers about algorithms and data structure. It dives deep into it all without losing the reader.
